Key players are RBPs that recognise cis-regulatory RNA sequence elements, such as short sequence motifs or structured RNA folds. However, the position and function of most cis-regulatory elements remain unknown, hindering the interpretation of disease-associated mutations and the resulting splicing changes.\n\n:::{#rna-regulation}\n:::\n\n## Regulatory Mechanisms in Human (Patho)Physiology\n\nRNA metabolism is often disturbed in human disease, including neurodegeneration and cancer. In collaboration with molecular biologists and pre-clinical researchers, we examine transcriptome changes under different pathophysiological conditions.\n\n:::{#disease}\n:::\n\n\n## DNA stability\n\nIf you are not stable you are not a DNA\n\n:::{#dna-stability}\n:::\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"projects.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"source","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"fontsize":"1.1em","linestretch":1.7,"title":"Projects","listing":[{"id":"dna-stability","contents":"project_posts/dna_stability/**/index.qmd","type":"grid"},{"id":"rna-regulation","contents":"project_posts/rna_regulation/**/index.qmd","type":"grid"},{"id":"disease","contents":"project_posts/disease/**/index.qmd","type":"grid"}]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
