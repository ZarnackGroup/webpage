Introduction\nCalcifer is a workflow for highly automated detection and analysis of circRNAs in RNA-Seq datasets. It allows the evaluation of RNA-Seq read data up to a list of characterized circRNA isoforms, as well as the prediction of possible functions.\n\n# 2. Overview\n\n![Calcifer workflow](calcifer_new_changed_workflow.png)\n\n# 3. CircRNA detection\nIn a first step the RNA-seq data is aligned with STAR [1] and bwa [2] against the reference genome. The resulting bam-files are used as input for CIRCexplorer2 [3] and CIRI2 [4] respectively. These both tools yield an unfiltered list of putative circRNAs, which is further processed.\n\n# 4. CircRNA filtering\nThe raw circRNA results from both tools are then further filtered for canonical splice sites, length of the circRNA, encompassing junctions and uniquely mapped back-splice junction reads. At the end only circRNAs which have at least 2 uniquely back-splice junction reads are considered for further analysis.\n\n# 5. Downstream analysis\nBased on the filtered circRNA list there is a broad downstream analysis. To shed light on putative biogenesis and function the downstream analysis consists out of detection of putative miRNA binding, RBP binding and open reading frames. \n\n#### 5.1. Linear and circular count data\nIn general a count matrix for linear and circular mapped reads is created. If needed these can be utilized by the user for differential expression analysis for multiple condition datasets. A rmd-file for a baseline DESeq2 analysis is included in the major workflow folder.\n\n#### 5.2. miRNA binding site detection\nMiRNA binding sites are detected by miRanda [5] on the circular exonic sequence for each circRNA. To enable miRNA binding analysis over the back-splice junction sequence, the linear sequence is extended by 25 bp from the opposite end respectively.\n\n#### 5.3. RBP binding site detection\nThe RBP binding prediction is performed with FIMO [6] on the same sequence (back-splice junction extended linear exon sequence) and additional on the not included sequence around the back-splice junction. CircRNA biogenesis can be enabled by RBP binding close to the back-splice junction. Also a putative function of circRNAs is the direct binding of RBPs.\n\n#### 5.4. ORF prediction\nThe ORF prediction is performed on the linear- as well as the pseudo-circular and multi-cycle exonic circRNA sequence. These enables the prediction of longer ORFs, which span over the back-splice junction as well as multiple reading frames.\n\n\n# Literature\n[1] Dobin, Alexander, et al. \"STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner.\" Bioinformatics 29.1 (2013): 15-21.\n\n[2] Li, H., & Durbin, R.
