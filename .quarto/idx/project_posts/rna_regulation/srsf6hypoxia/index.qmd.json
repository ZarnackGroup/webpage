In this project SRSF6 was found to be a key factor in the AS response to hypoxia. A strong reduction in SRSF6 levels in acute hypoxia led to exon skipping and triggered nuclear speckle dispersal as a mechanism for the cell to reprogram the gene expression profile. We found this mechanism to be active in various cancer types and further propose a tumor suppressor function.\n\nThe full manuscript can be found at [Nucleic Acids Research](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/51/2/870/6976068).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":"source","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"fontsize":"1.1em","linestretch":1.7,"title":"SRSF6 poison cassette exon splicing as hypoxia response","description":"Poison cassette exon splicing of SRSF6 regulates nuclear speckle dispersal and the response to hypoxia","author":"Mirko Brüggemann","date":"2023-01-09","image":"hypoxia_icon.png","draft":false,"categories":["Hypoxia","RNA-Seq","iCLIP"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
