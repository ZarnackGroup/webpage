In this project we found a remarkable degree of CAF herterogenity which changed during mammary cancer development. We created whole transcriptome longitudinal data on CAF development from early- and late-stage tumors and observed a shift in fibroblast populations over time, which was negatively associated with patient survival. We then trained a random forest classification model to compute a gene signature that had predicive power in bulk tumor patient samples.\n\nThe full manuscript can be found at [International Journal of Molecular Sciences](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/20/18/4438).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.475","editor":"source","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"fontsize":"1.1em","linestretch":1.7,"title":"Phenotypic Plasticity of Fibroblasts during Mammary Carcinoma Development","description":"Cancer-associated fibroblasts populations change over time during mammary carcinoma tumor development","author":"SFB-902","image":"cafs_icon.png","draft":false,"categories":["Cancer","RNA-Seq"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
