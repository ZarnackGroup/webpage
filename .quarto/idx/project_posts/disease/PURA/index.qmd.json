In neurodegenerative RNA-repeat\nexpansion disorders like ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and FTD\n(frontotemporal dementia), PURA has been found to bind to neuronal\naggregates. On the other hand, spontaneous de novo mutations of the PURA\ngene lead to a neurodevelopmental disease known as PURA Syndrome.\nDespite its significance, our understanding of the molecular pathways\naffected by PURA in healthy cells and its association with these\ndiseases remains limited.\n\nTo bridge this knowledge gap, we teamed up with the groups of Professor\nDr. Dierk Niessing at Universität Ulm and Helmholtz Zentrum München. Our\nprimary objective is to shed light on the cellular function of PURA in\nhealthy cells, an endeavor we have already begun to explore in our\npublication titled \"Depletion of the RNA-binding protein PURA triggers\nchanges in posttranscriptional gene regulation and loss of P-bodies\"\n([Molitor & Klostermann et al., Nucleic Acids\nResearch](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36651277/)).\n\nIn our publication, we unveil the predominant cytoplasmic localization\nof PURA, where it interacts with thousands of mRNAs. Remarkably, the\ndepletion of PURA leads to changes in the abundance of numerous\ntranscripts. Based on the proteins encoded by these transcripts, we\npropose that PURA plays a pivotal role in immune responses,\nmitochondrial function, autophagy, and processing (P)-body activity.\nNotably, decreased levels of PURA impact the expression of essential\nP-body components, LSM14A and DDX6, consequently influencing the\nformation and composition of this phase-separated RNA processing\nmachinery in human cells.\n\nBuilding upon these findings, our next step involves expanding our\nunderstanding of the effects of PURA syndrome through the utilization of\nphysiological cell lines and diverse disease models.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","editor":{"markdown":{"wrap":72}},"theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"fontsize":"1.1em","linestretch":1.7,"title":"Understanding the function of PURA in healthy organisms and in the context of PURA Syndrome.","description":"We work on understanding the function of the misterous PURA protein.
