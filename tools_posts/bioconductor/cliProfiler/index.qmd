## The cliProfiler package extension

Cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) is a technique that combines UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation to analyse protein-RNA interactions or to pinpoint RNA modifications (e.g. m6A). CLIP-based methods, such as iCLIP and eCLIP, allow precise mapping of RNA modification sites or RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding sites on a genome-wide scale. These techniques help us to unravel post-transcriptional regulatory networks. In order to make the visualization of CLIP data easier, we develop `cliProfiler` package. The `cliProfiler` includes seven functions which allow users easily make different profile plots.

The cliProfiler package is available at https://bioconductor.org and can be access with the
