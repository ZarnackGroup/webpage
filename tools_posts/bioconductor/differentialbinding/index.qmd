## The Differential binding package extension

![](./diff.png){width="806"}

Understanding condition specific affinity changes of a RNA-binding protein (RBP) to a known binding site is the next level of understanding (post-) transcriptional regulartory processes in more detail.

The `DifferentialBinding` module will extend the `BindingSiteFinder` by various new features and functionalities, suited to identify RBP specific binding site changes in a transcriptome wide fashion. The extention is soon to be released and can be found on the `BindingSiteFinder` [Bioconductor page](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BindingSiteFinder.html).
