racoon_clip is a commandline tool, that automates the CLIP processing pipeline from [Busch et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202318304948). It can processes both iCLIP and eCLIP data and outputs the crosslinking signal with single-nucleotide resolution.

You can find the documentation [here](https://racoon-clip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
