## Learning the Molecular Code of RNA Regulation

RNA regulation plays a major role in cellular function, and alterations such as alternative splicing are frequently implicated in human disease including cancer. Key players are RBPs that recognise cis-regulatory RNA sequence elements, such as short sequence motifs or structured RNA folds. However, the position and function of most cis-regulatory elements remain unknown, hindering the interpretation of disease-associated mutations and the resulting splicing changes.

## Regulatory Mechanisms in Human (Patho)Physiology

RNA metabolism is often disturbed in human disease, including neurodegeneration and cancer. In collaboration with molecular biologists and pre-clinical researchers, we examine transcriptome changes under different pathophysiological conditions.
