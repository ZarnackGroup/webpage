We observed a direct interaction with the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC1) as well as precice position upstream of poly(A) tails in the mRNA.Thus we propose that MKRN1 mediates the recognition of poly(A) tails to prevent the production of erroneous proteins from prematurely polyadenylated transcripts, thereby maintaining proteome integrity.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Genome Biology."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The protein PURA (purine-rich element binding protein A) is at the center of scientific investigation due to its involvement in two distinct types of neuronal diseases. In neurodegenerative RNA-repeat expansion disorders like ALS (Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) and FTD (frontotemporal dementia), PURA has been found to bind to neuronal aggregates. On the other hand, spontaneous de novo mutations of the PURA gene lead to a neurodevelopmental disease known as PURA Syndrome. Despite its significance, our understanding of the molecular pathways affected by PURA in healthy cells and its association with these diseases remains limited. To bridge this knowledge gap, we teamed up with the groups of Professor Dr. Dierk Niessing at Universität Ulm and Helmholtz Zentrum München. Our primary objective is to shed light on the cellular function of PURA in healthy cells, an endeavor we have already begun to explore in our publication titled “Depletion of the RNA-binding protein PURA triggers changes in posttranscriptional gene regulation and loss of P-bodies” (Molitor & Klostermann et al., Nucleic Acids Research). In our publication, we unveil the predominant cytoplasmic localization of PURA, where it interacts with thousands of mRNAs. Remarkably, the depletion of PURA leads to changes in the abundance of numerous transcripts. Based on the proteins encoded by these transcripts, we propose that PURA plays a pivotal role in immune responses, mitochondrial function, autophagy, and processing (P)-body activity. Notably, decreased levels of PURA impact the expression of essential P-body components, LSM14A and DDX6, consequently influencing the formation and composition of this phase-separated RNA processing machinery in human cells. Building upon these findings, our next step involves expanding our understanding of the effects of PURA syndrome through the utilization of physiological cell lines and diverse disease models."

    "text": "Our research focuses on understanding the mechanisms behind genome rearrangements caused by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). These rearrangements can have both positive and negative effects, contributing to genetic diversity and disease development, particularly cancer. While we have knowledge about externally induced DNA fragile sites, the factors influencing spontaneous DSBs in different genomic regions and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In collaboration with our partners, we employ advanced genomics techniques to analyze DNA breaks at the nucleotide level and investigate chromatin interactions using chromosome conformation capture methods. Recent studies have demonstrated that transcription and the three-dimensional folding of the genome influence the occurrence of oncogenic rearrangements induced by chemotherapy. Additionally, our collaborators have identified a class of endogenous DNA fragile hotspots that differ from those induced by drugs. During the next phase of our project, we aim to uncover the sources of intrinsic DNA fragility and explore how they contribute to recurrent rearrangements and tissue-specific oncogenesis. By integrating the genomics data generated in the Roukos lab with computational analysis and machine learning, we will develop a comprehensive collection of intrinsic DNA fragility maps across various human cell types. Our research will investigate the relationship between DNA fragility and gene expression, chromatin organization, and three-dimensional chromosome structure. We will focus on the roles of non-canonical DNA structures, such as R-loops and G-quadruplexes, as well as incomplete topoisomerase actions, and their potential interference with replication and transcription. Utilizing machine learning models, we will construct predictive models for identifying intrinsic DNA fragility in the human genome and identify the most influential features and their interdependencies. Moreover, by integrating our findings with publicly available structural variants identified in cancer patient samples, we aim to identify tissue-specific genomic instability hotspots. Our project seeks to unravel why certain regions of the genome are more prone to breakage, providing valuable insights into the emergence of recurrent genome rearrangements and their association with oncogenesis."

    "text": "Calcifer: A workflow for circRNA detection and analysis\nAuthor: Andre Brezski, Kathi Zarnack\n\n\n\n1. Introduction\nCalcifer is a workflow for highly automated detection and analysis of circRNAs in RNA-Seq datasets. It allows the evaluation of RNA-Seq read data up to a list of characterized circRNA isoforms, as well as the prediction of possible functions.\n\n\n2. Overview\n\n\n\nCalcifer workflow\n\n\n\n\n3. CircRNA detection\nIn a first step the RNA-seq data is aligned with STAR [1] and bwa [2] against the reference genome. The resulting bam-files are used as input for CIRCexplorer2 [3] and CIRI2 [4] respectively. These both tools yield an unfiltered list of putative circRNAs, which is further processed.\n\n\n4. CircRNA filtering\nThe raw circRNA results from both tools are then further filtered for canonical splice sites, length of the circRNA, encompassing junctions and uniquely mapped back-splice junction reads. At the end only circRNAs which have at least 2 uniquely back-splice junction reads are considered for further analysis.\n\n\n5. Downstream analysis\nBased on the filtered circRNA list there is a broad downstream analysis. To shed light on putative biogenesis and function the downstream analysis consists out of detection of putative miRNA binding, RBP binding and open reading frames.\n\n5.1. Linear and circular count data\nIn general a count matrix for linear and circular mapped reads is created. If needed these can be utilized by the user for differential expression analysis for multiple condition datasets. A rmd-file for a baseline DESeq2 analysis is included in the major workflow folder.\n\n\n5.2. miRNA binding site detection\nMiRNA binding sites are detected by miRanda [5] on the circular exonic sequence for each circRNA. To enable miRNA binding analysis over the back-splice junction sequence, the linear sequence is extended by 25 bp from the opposite end respectively.\n\n\n5.3. RBP binding site detection\nThe RBP binding prediction is performed with FIMO [6] on the same sequence (back-splice junction extended linear exon sequence) and additional on the not included sequence around the back-splice junction. CircRNA biogenesis can be enabled by RBP binding close to the back-splice junction. Also a putative function of circRNAs is the direct binding of RBPs.\n\n\n5.4. ORF prediction\nThe ORF prediction is performed on the linear- as well as the pseudo-circular and multi-cycle exonic circRNA sequence. These enables the prediction of longer ORFs, which span over the back-splice junction as well as multiple reading frames.\n\n\n\nLiterature\n[1] Dobin, Alexander, et al. “STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner.” Bioinformatics 29.1 (2013): 15-21.\n[2] Li, H., & Durbin, R.

    "text": "{width = “600”, height = “600}\nCross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) is a technique that combines UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation to analyse protein-RNA interactions or to pinpoint RNA modifications (e.g. m6A). CLIP-based methods, such as iCLIP and eCLIP, allow precise mapping of RNA modification sites or RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding sites on a genome-wide scale. These techniques help us to unravel post-transcriptional regulatory networks. In order to make the visualization of CLIP data easier, we develop cliProfiler package. The cliProfiler includes seven functions which allow users easily make different profile plots.\nThe cliProfiler package is available at https://bioconductor.org and can be access with the following link: https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cliProfiler.html."

    "text": "Calcifer: A workflow for circRNA detection and analysis\nAuthor: Andre Brezski, Kathi Zarnack\n\n\n\n1. Introduction\nCalcifer is a workflow for highly automated detection and analysis of circRNAs in RNA-Seq datasets. It allows the evaluation of RNA-Seq read data up to a list of characterized circRNA isoforms, as well as the prediction of possible functions.\n\n\n2. Overview\n\n\n\nCalcifer workflow\n\n\n\n\n3. CircRNA detection\nIn a first step the RNA-seq data is aligned with STAR [1] and bwa [2] against the reference genome. The resulting bam-files are used as input for CIRCexplorer2 [3] and CIRI2 [4] respectively. These both tools yield an unfiltered list of putative circRNAs, which is further processed.\n\n\n4. CircRNA filtering\nThe raw circRNA results from both tools are then further filtered for canonical splice sites, length of the circRNA, encompassing junctions and uniquely mapped back-splice junction reads. At the end only circRNAs which have at least 2 uniquely back-splice junction reads are considered for further analysis.\n\n\n5. Downstream analysis\nBased on the filtered circRNA list there is a broad downstream analysis. To shed light on putative biogenesis and function the downstream analysis consists out of detection of putative miRNA binding, RBP binding and open reading frames.\n\n5.1. Linear and circular count data\nIn general a count matrix for linear and circular mapped reads is created. If needed these can be utilized by the user for differential expression analysis for multiple condition datasets. A rmd-file for a baseline DESeq2 analysis is included in the major workflow folder.\n\n\n5.2. miRNA binding site detection\nMiRNA binding sites are detected by miRanda [5] on the circular exonic sequence for each circRNA. To enable miRNA binding analysis over the back-splice junction sequence, the linear sequence is extended by 25 bp from the opposite end respectively.\n\n\n5.3. RBP binding site detection\nThe RBP binding prediction is performed with FIMO [6] on the same sequence (back-splice junction extended linear exon sequence) and additional on the not included sequence around the back-splice junction. CircRNA biogenesis can be enabled by RBP binding close to the back-splice junction. Also a putative function of circRNAs is the direct binding of RBPs.\n\n\n5.4. ORF prediction\nThe ORF prediction is performed on the linear- as well as the pseudo-circular and multi-cycle exonic circRNA sequence. These enables the prediction of longer ORFs, which span over the back-splice junction as well as multiple reading frames.\n\n\n\nLiterature\n[1] Dobin, Alexander, et al. “STAR: ultrafast universal RNA-seq aligner.” Bioinformatics 29.1 (2013): 15-21.\n[2] Li, H., & Durbin, R.

This information can be obtained from individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) experiments. In this project we discribed the complete bioinformatic data analysis workflow to reliably detect RBP binding sites from iCLIP data. The workflow covers all steps from the initial quality control of the sequencing reads up to peak calling and quantification of RBP binding. For each tool, we explain the specific requirements for iCLIP data analysis and suggest optimized parameter settings.\nThe full manuscript can be found at Methods and an updated version of the binding site definition part is published as the R/ Bioconductor packge BindingSiteFinder Bioconductor page."
