## The effect of SRSF6 poison cassette exon splicing in hypoxia

![](./hypoxia.png){width="669"}

Hypoxia induces massive changes in alternative splicing (AS) to adapt cells to the lack of oxygen. In this project SRSF6 was found to be a key factor in the AS response to hypoxia. A strong reduction in SRSF6 levels in acute hypoxia led to exon skipping and triggered nuclear speckle dispersal as a mechanism for the cell to reprogram the gene expression profile. We found this mechanism to be active in various cancer types and further propose a tumor suppressor function.
