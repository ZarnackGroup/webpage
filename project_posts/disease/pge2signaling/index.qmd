## The effect of Prostaglandin E2 Signaling disruption in Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts

![](./pge2.png)

The activation and differentiation of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are involved in tumor progression. Here, we showed that the tumor-promoting lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays a paradoxical role in CAF activation and tumor progression. The inflammatory lipid prostaglandin E2 suppresses cancer-associated fibroblast expansion and activation limited primary mammary tumor growth while promoting metastasis. These data characterized in this project suggests a new pathway of regulating inflammatory CAF activation, which affects breast cancer progression.
